Here are a few scripts that I wrote to help with some genetic genealogy research.

These are for extracting data from a VCF file:
vcf_file_chromosome_extractor_1
vcf_file_chromosome_extractor_2

The remaining lua scripts are part of a workflow I used to augument my test results with those from my parents, to increase the covered alleles, and then convert the results back into 23andme format, for input into other analysis tools.

The SQL entry was for uploading the resulting csv into a local postgres database.
