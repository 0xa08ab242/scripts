Here are a few lua scripts that I wrote to help baby name ideas.

ssn_yob_fileconversion_singleout.lua - reads in the various ssn per year of birth name files ( within the range of years providede) and outputs a single file with all the results.

ssn_yob_aggregate_filtered_output.lua - searches the file created by the prior script for matching names and outputs the results in chronological order of popularity by year and gender.
