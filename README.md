a growing collection of loose scripts I left laying about, put here to be easier for me to find...

most of these were useful (at least briefly) in a work or hobby setting
all have had any compromising bits removed or changed

languages used:
bash
lua
perl
python
ruby

this includes a subset of examples:
lua implementation of Luhn test
lua multi-delimitted file splitter with string matching for old MS Exchange logs
perl with estreamer API to connect to Sourcefire appliances from a Windows PC
python with JSON API to connect to Splunk apps website
python HTML scraping to grab logs from my cable modem
