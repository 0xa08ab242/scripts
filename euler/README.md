a place to stash a few different approaches to a public set of problems (https://projecteuler.net/archives)

this is more of a point-in-time self-reflection exercise to look at how I would tend to attack these problems on a language by language basis, since the underlying mathematical objective remains the same for each problem

this is a very low priority effort

problem 1 working solutions in the following languages:
	Lua
	Perl
	Python
	Ruby

problem 1 solutions yet to be drafted in the following languages:
	c
	Common Lisp
	Go

problem 1 solutions under consideration to be drafted in the following languages:
	Assembler (FASM/Linux||BSD || MASM/Windows TBD.)
	Elixir/Erlang
	Fortran
	J
	Javascript/node.js
	Rust
